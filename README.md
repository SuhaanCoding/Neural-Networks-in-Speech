# Speech Command CNN Experiments

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks for training and evaluating convolutional neural networks on speech command classification tasks. The experiments compare three different activation functions: Tanh, ReLU, and Leaky ReLU.

## What's included

- `model_experiments.ipynb` - Main notebook that runs experiments with all three activation functions
- `experiments_tanh.ipynb` - Focused experiments using Tanh activation only
- `experiments_relu.ipynb` - Focused experiments using ReLU activation only  
- `experiments_leaky_relu.ipynb` - Focused experiments using Leaky ReLU activation only

## Getting started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/speech-command-cnn-notebooks.git
cd speech-command-cnn-notebooks
pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter notebook
```

Open any notebook and update the dataset path, then run the cells.
